# PasswordGenerator

Assignment Task:
To create a random password generator using JavaScript, based off of criteria selected by the user.

Acceptance Criteria:
The task required several things to be included in order to be successful:
- Based off the prompt of having the generate password button clicked, a series of confirmation windows would open to allow the user to select what is to be included in the password.
- The user would decide upon the length of the password, as well as which character types would be included.
- The code would validate whether the user inputted a number between 8 and 128 for the password length, and ensure the user selected at least one character type. 
- The generated password would be random and would match the selection criteria.
